Greetings, This is Bangladeshi native Md. Tamzid Hasan. As a research assistant, I am employed at North South University's NSU Global Health Institute (NGHI). The family I come from is middle class. I must be extremely polite, truthful, and timely in my line of work. As a good listener, I support people in speaking freely, having an open mind, and constantly show respect for the opinions of others.
I received my master's degree in public health with an epidemiology specialisation from North South University in 2023. I have a special interest in epidemiology, immunisations, public health surveillance, mother and child health, and sexual and reproductive health.

My ability to multitask successfully is enhanced by my strong leadership and interpersonal communication skills, which enable me to work well in teams and groups. Good collaboration with EPI, MNC&AH, DGHS, MoHFW, Bangladesh, and other international organisations is also important. Strong workshop and training material creation skills.

To inquire about any career opportunities or to share any questions, send me an- 
Email at thunique1988@gmail.com. or WhatsApp me at +880 1711 927924.
